# Python_GuessTheNumberGame

Also know as 终极密码 ('Zhong Ji Mi Ma') (Guessing the Password)

This game is usually played in a group setting, where 1 game master selects a secret number between 1 to 99. Other players will then take turns guessing the number, and the game master will narrow the range of numbers accordingly, until a player guesses the secret number, or until the next player is forced to pick the secret number due to the range having only 1 number left to pick. The player that guesses the secret number loses the round and usually need to do some sort of forfeit, before taking over as the new game master to set the next secret number for the next round.

For the Python game setup, I utilise a random number generator to generate a secret number (removing the need for a game master), and players can all take turn to input their guesses.
